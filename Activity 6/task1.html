Comments are used in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add explanatory notes, reminders, or
explanations within the code. They are not visible to users when the code is executed;
rather, they serve as annotations for developers to understand the code better.


1. HTML Comments:
comments are wrapped between <!-- and -->.
Example:
<!--This is a comment in HTML-->
<p>This is a paragraph</p>


2. CSS Comments:
Comments are closed between /* and */
Example:
/* this is a comment in css*/
P{
Color: blue;
}


3. JavaScript Comments:
You have both single- line comment using // and multi- line comments using ‘/* */’
Example:
// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
var x = 5; // This is also a single-line comment
/* This is a
multi-line
comment in JavaScript */
